# Deep Learning Course – Jupyter Notebooks

Welcome to the **Deep Learning Course** repository.  
This repository contains a set of **Jupyter notebooks** designed for students to learn deep learning concepts through **hands-on coding and experimentation**.

🔗 **GitHub Repository:**

## 📚 Course Overview

This course introduces core and advanced concepts in **Deep Learning**, combining theoretical explanations with practical implementations.  
Each topic is provided as a **Jupyter Notebook** that students can:

- Run cell by cell
- Modify and experiment with
- Use as a reference for assignments and projects

The notebooks include both **framework-independent implementations** and **Keras-based implementations** to help students understand concepts at different abstraction levels.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

These notebooks are educational, not production-ready.

Code clarity and understanding are prioritized.

Students are encouraged to:

1. Modify code
2. Experiment with parameters
3. Explore alternative architectures

## 📌 Notes for Students
Read the markdown explanations in each notebook carefully.
Run cells in order.

Save your work regularly.

Experiment beyond the provided examples.
